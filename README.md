#  Highly Adaptive Regression Trees

Highly Adaptive Regression Trees (HART) is a method for mapping Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) model fits to decision trees. The files in this repository allow for reproduction of results shown in our paper submitted to NeurIPS 2021 as well as general experimentation with HAL and HART. Code was written in R version 4.0.3 (distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3) and Python version 3.7 (distributed under the terms of the PSF license agreement). There are 3 main things to explore/reproduce in this code.

# 1. HART Size and Performance

# 2. HART Size and Performance With Heavy L1 Penalization

# 3. Performance of Other Algorithms (randomForest and CART/rpart)
