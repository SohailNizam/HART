#A shell script to call R+Py scripts, get HART evaluation data
#Either based on HAL built with many seeds or HAL built under
#one seed with many l1 penalty terms

#$1 is 1 or 0, 1 means run l1 experiments, 0 means run hal with many seeds
#$2 is the name of the dataset you want to analyze
#$3 is the number of fits you want to build trees out of
#for HAL.R this is probably the number of seeds you specified in the csv file (default = 100)
#for l1_experiments.R this 85 unless changed in the script

#If l1 = 0, first run HAL.R with chosen dataset name

else

#and num_fits = number of fits generated by HAL.R that you
#want to evaluate
