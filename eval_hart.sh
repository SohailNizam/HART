#A shell script to call R+Py scripts, get HART evaluation data
#Either based on HAL built with many seeds or HAL built under
#one seed with many l1 penalty terms

#If l1 = 0, first run HAL.R with chosen dataset name

#If l1 = 1, first run l1_experiments.R with chosen dataset name

#Next run HART.py with chosen dataset name, l1,
#and num_fits = number of fits generated by HAL.R that you
#want to evaluate
